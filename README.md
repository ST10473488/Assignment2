## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [To learn and gain knowledge]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [Allows users to register and log in securely using email and password authentication. User progress and scores are saved for personalized tracking.]
- Feature 2: [Displays multiple-choice questions with timers and scores. Users get instant feedback on answeres and can review results at the end.]
- Feature 3: [Sends reminders to users to complete their daily quiz, encouraging consistance learning and engagement]

These features aim to provide [Users progress and scores are saved for personalized tracking.].

## Design Considerations

The design of the **[Quiz App]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Implementing the login system using Kotlin in Android Studio]
   - **Solution**: [I discovered that certain views were ont rendering. I adjusted the theme, made sure all required dependencies were loaded.]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Structuring quiz data and managing state across multiple questions.]
   - **Solution**: [I used ViewModel and LiveData to maintain quiz progress, enabling a smooth experience even when device orientation changes or activity restarts.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Allowing users to set daily or weekly reminders to complete quizzes, helping build consistent learning habits.]
2. **Feature 2**: [Integrating Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database to store user progress, scores, and quiz data online — enabling multi-device support and data backup.]
3. **Feature 3**: [Adding a toggle for dark mode to improve user comfort during night-time use and align with modern UI preferences.]
